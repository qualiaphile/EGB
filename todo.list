In general:

* learn more about k[x]*[G]; e.g., annihilator ideals

* extend to other types of k[x]*[G]-modules

* in particular, k[x_{ij}] with G acting on j and i=1..m

* define an affine and projective variety? as a zero set? are there infinite-dim proper varieties? (G=S_\infty) Chris!!!

* understand relationship/difference G-Groebner Bases and S-Groebner Bases (S = full symmetric group, G = Inc Monoid)

Software:

* automate going through all the "k"; crash if k=2

* library of examples and a script that goes through all of them and compares with the known output (also with Sage)

* refine the procedure creating (minimal) s-pairs

* "slow" reduction can be preceded by the "fast" one (look at Sage implementation)

Applications:

* reproduce known results, e.g., in algebraic statistics

* coloring edges of bipartite graphs
