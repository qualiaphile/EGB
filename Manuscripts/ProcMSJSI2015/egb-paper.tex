\subsection{Structure of the paper}

\section{Preliminaries}
Let $R$ be a commutative $K$-algebra equipped with a left action of monoid $\Pi$ (a $\Pi$-algebra structure).  We mainly consider the case where $R$ has the structure of a monoid algebra, that is for some abelian monoid $\mon$, the elements of $R$ consist of formal sums of elements of $\mon$ with coefficients in $K$.  An example of such a monoid algebra is polynomial ring $R = K[X]$ with variables from the set $X$.  In this case $\mon$ is the free abelian monoid generated by $X$, which we will denote by $[X]$.  To make our notation consistent with the polynomial case, we will denote the monoid algebra of $\mon$ over $K$ by $K\mon$ even though this is not standard (often it is written as $K[\mon]$ but this creates ambiguity with polynomial rings).  We will also generally refer to elements of $\mon$ as ``monomials'' in analogy to the polynomial case.  Additionally we will assume that $\Pi$ acts on monoid algebra $R$ through a $\Pi$-action on $\mon$ by monoid homomorphisms.

Our particular focus in this paper is when $\Pi$ is $\SymN$ or certain related monoids.  For our purposes $\SymN$ will be defined as the group of all finite permutations of $\B N$, meaning permutations that fix all but a finite number of elements.

\begin{example}
 Let $R = K[x_1,x_2,x_3,\ldots]$ with $\SymN$ acting on $R$ by permuting the variables, so that $\sigma x_i = x_{\sigma(i)}$.
\end{example}

\begin{definition}
 An ideal $I \subseteq R$ is a {\em $\Pi$-invariant ideal} if $\sigma I \subseteq I$ for all $\sigma \in \Pi$.
\end{definition}

The ring $R$ is both an $R$-algebra and a $\Pi$-algebra, and there is a ring $R*\Pi$ which captures both of these actions, and which will be referred to as the {\em twisted monoid ring} of $\Pi$ with coefficients in $R$.  The elements of $R*\Pi$ are of the form $\sum_{\sigma \in \Pi} f_{\sigma}\cdot \sigma$ with each $f_\sigma \in R$ and only a finite number non-zero.  The additive structure is the same as the usual monoid ring, but multiplication is ``twisted'' in that
 \[ (f\cdot \sigma)(g \cdot \tau) = f\sigma(g) \cdot \sigma\tau \]
where $\sigma(g)$ denotes the element of $R$ obtained by acting on $g$ by $\sigma$.

$R$ is a $R*\Pi$-module, and the definition of $\Pi$-invariant ideals can be restated as $R*\Pi$-submodules of $R$.

When $R = K\mon$ with $\Pi$ acting on $\mon$, then we can define monoid $\mon *\Pi$ whose elements are pairs in $\mon \times \Pi$ with monoid operation
 \[ (m, \sigma)(n, \tau) = (m\sigma(n), \sigma\tau). \]
There is a left action of $\mon*\Pi$ on $\mon$ and the elements of $\mon *\Pi$ are the ``monomials'' of $R*\Pi$.

\begin{definition}
 A $\Pi$-invariant ideal $I \subseteq R$ is {\em $\Pi$-finitely generated} if there is a finite set $F \subseteq I$ such that the $\Pi$-orbits of the elements of $F$ generate $I$.  Ring $R$ is called {\em $\Pi$-Noetherian} if every $\Pi$-invariant ideal in $R$ is $\Pi$-finitely generated.
\end{definition}
If a $\Pi$-invariant ideal $I$ is generated by the $\Pi$-orbits of a set $F$, we will write
 \[ I = \ideal{F}_{\Pi}. \]
Such a set $F$ generates $I$ as an $R*\Pi$-module.

We can also say that monoid $\mon$ with $\Pi$-action is $\Pi$-finitely generated if it generated by the $\Pi$-orbits of a finite number of elements.  Then $R = K\mon$ is $\Pi$-finitely generated as a $K$-algebra.

\begin{example}
 Continuing the above example of $R = K[x_1,x_2,x_3,\ldots]$ with $\SymN$ action, the ideal $\F m = \ideal{x_1,x_2,x_3,\ldots}$ is a $\SymN$-invariant ideal.  Moreover, it is $\SymN$-finitely generated because $\F m = \ideal{x_1}_{\SymN}$.  Also $R$ is a $\SymN$-finitely generated $K$-algebra with generator $x_1$.
\end{example}
 

\begin{definition}
 Let $R$ be a $\SymN$-algebra.  For $f \in R$, the {\em width} of $f$ is the smallest integer $n$ such that for every $\sigma \in \SymN$ that fixes $\{1,\ldots,n\}$, $\sigma$ also fixes $f$.  The width of $f$ is denoted $w(f)$.  If no such integer $n$ exists, then $w(f) = \infty$.  For a set $F \subseteq R$, its width is $w(F) := \max_{f \in F}\{w(f)\}$.
\end{definition}
If every element of $R$ has finite width, we will say that $R$ satisfies the {\em finite width condition}.  This is primarily the situation we want to address in this paper, and so we will assume from here forward that all rings with $\Sym$-action satisfy the finite width condition unless stated otherwise.  For a $\SymN$-invariant ideal $I \subseteq R$ and an integer $n$ we can define the $n$th truncation of $I$ as
 \[ I_n := \{ f \in I \mid w(f) \leq n \}. \]
The set $I_n$ is naturally a $\F S_n$-invariant ideal of $R_n$.  If $R$ satisfies the finite width condition, then $I$ is the union of all of its truncations.  If moreover $I$ is $\SymN$-finitely generated, then there is sufficiently large $n \in \B N$ such that $I = \ideal{I_n}_{\SymN}$.

The definition of width also applies to $\Pi = \Inc$, the monoid of strictly increasing functions, which is introduced below.
 
\begin{definition}
 Given $R = K\mon$ with $\Pi$ acting on $\mon$, there is a natural partial order $|_\Pi$ on $\mon$ called the {\em $\Pi$-divisibility partial order} defined by $a |_\Pi b$ if there exists $\sigma \in \Pi$ such that $\sigma a$ divides $b$.  Equivalently $a |_\Pi b$ if $b \in \ideal{a}_\Pi$.
\end{definition}

Recall that a monomial order on $R = K\mon$ is a total order $\leq$ on $\mon$ that is a well-order, and that respects multiplication, meaning if $a \leq b$ then $ac \leq bc$ for all $c \in \mon$.

\begin{definition}
 A monomial order $\leq$ on $R = K\mon$ {\em respects $\Pi$} if whenever $a \leq b$ then $\sigma a \leq \sigma b$ for all $\sigma \in \Pi$.
\end{definition}

Therefore order $\leq$ is a $\Pi$-respecting monomial order on $R$ if $\leq$ is a total well-order on $M$ that respects the action of $\mon*\Pi$.
Now we have the tools to describe the $\Pi$-equivariant version of Gr\"obner bases.
\begin{definition}
 Let $R = K\mon$ be a monoid ring with $\Pi$ action on $\mon$, and let $\leq$ be a $\Pi$ respecting monomial order.  Given a $\Pi$-invariant ideal $I \subseteq R$, a {\em $\Pi$-equivariant Gr\"obner basis} of $I$ is a set $G \subseteq I$ such that the $\Pi$ orbits of $G$ form a Gr\"obner basis of $I$,
 \[ \ideal{\LT \Pi G} = \LT I. \]
\end{definition}
We require $\leq$ to be a $\Pi$ respecting order because it is equivalent to the condition that
\[ \LT \sigma f = \sigma \LT f \]
for all $f \in R$ and $\sigma \in \Pi$.  Therefore with such an order
 \[ \ideal{\LT G}_{\Pi} = \ideal{\LT \Pi G} = \LT I. \]
This also implies that $\LT I$ is a $\Pi$-invariant ideal.  Note that since the $\Pi$ orbits of $G$ are a Gr\"obner basis of $I$, we have $\ideal{G}_\Pi = I$.


\begin{proposition}[Remark 2.1 of \cite{Brouwer09e}]\label{prop:nogroup}
 Let $\Pi$ be a group which acts non-trivially on $\mon$.  Then $K\mon$ has no $\Pi$ respecting monomial orders.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
 Suppose that $\leq$ is a $\Pi$ respecting order and choose $\sigma \in \Pi$ and $m \in \mon$ such that $m \neq \sigma m$.  If $m > \sigma m$ then $\sigma^n m > \sigma^{n+1} m$ for all $n$ so
  \[ m > \sigma m > \sigma^2 m > \cdots \]
 is an infinite descending chain of monomials, contradicting the fact that $\leq$ is a well-order.  If $m < \sigma m$ then $m > \sigma^{-1} m > \sigma^{-2} m > \cdots$ is an infinite descending chain.
\end{proof}

In particular this means that $R$ with non-trivial $\Sym$ action has no $\Sym$ respecting monomial orders.  To deal with this problem, a related monoid is introduced to replace $\Sym$ which allows for monomial orders but is somehow large enough compared to $\Sym$ not to break properties like finite generation.

Define the {\em monoid of strictly increasing functions} as
\[ \Inc := \{ \rho:\B N \to \B N \mid \text{ for all } a < b, \rho(a) < \rho(b) \}. \]
For any $\Sym$-algebra $R$ with the finite width property, there is a natural action of $\Inc$ on $R$ as follows.  Fixing $f \in R$, for any $\sigma \in \Sym$ the value of $\sigma f$ depends only on the restriction $\sigma|_{[w(f)]}$ considering $\sigma$ as a function $\B N \to \B N$.  For any $\rho \in \Inc$ there exists $\sigma \in \Sym$ such that $\sigma|_{[w(f)]} = \rho|_{[w(f)]}$ and define $\rho f = \sigma f$.  It can be checked that this gives a well-defined action of $\Inc$ on $R$.

It immediately follows from the definition of the action that $\Inc f \subseteq \Sym f$.  Despite the fact that $\Inc$ is not a submonoid of $\Sym$, it behaves like one in terms of its action on $R$.  An injective map $\sigma|_{[w(f)]}: [w(f)] \to \B N$ can always be factored into $\rho' \circ \tau$ with $\tau \in \F S_{w(f)}$ and $\rho':[w(f)] \to \B N$ a strictly increasing function.  The map $\rho'$ can be extended to some $\rho \in \Inc$, and then $\sigma f = \rho (\tau f)$.  Thus
 \[ \Sym f = \bigcup_{\tau \in \F S_{w(f)}} \Inc(\tau f). \]
This fact that the $\Sym$-orbit of any $f$ is a finite union of $\Inc$-orbits implies the following statements.

\begin{proposition}
 Let $R$ be a $\Sym$-algebra satisfying the finite width condition, and let $I\subseteq R$ be a $\Sym$-invariant ideal.
 \begin{itemize}
  \item $I$ is $\Inc$-invariant.
  \item $I$ is $\Sym$-finitely generated if and only if $I$ is $\Inc$-finitely generated.
  \item If $R$ is $\Inc$-Noetherian then $R$ is $\Sym$-Noetherian.
 \end{itemize}
\end{proposition}

When computing Gr\"obner bases of $\Sym$-invariant ideals we will work with the $\Inc$ action instead.  If $G$ is an $\Inc$-equivariant Gr\"obner basis for $\Sym$-invariant ideal $I$, then the $\Sym$-orbits of $G$ also form a Gr\"obner basis of $I$.  Generally the rings we are interested in will have $\Inc$ respecting monomial orders.

\begin{example}
 Let $R = K[x_1,x_2,\ldots]$ with $\Inc$-action defined by $\rho \cdot x_i = x_{\rho(i)}$.  The lexicographic order $\leq$ on the monomials of $R$ with $x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \cdots$ is a $\Inc$ respecting monomial order.  This is the only possible lexicographic order on $R$ that respects $\Inc$.  There are also a graded lexicographic and a graded reverse lexicographic order on $R$ that respect $\Inc$.  There is no $\Inc$ respecting monomial order on $R$ that is defined by a single weight vector in $\B R^{\B N}$.
\end{example}

It is an open question to characterize all possible $\Inc$ respecting monomial orders on a given ring $K\mon$ with $\Inc$ action.  We can make the following statement about such orders.

\begin{proposition}
 If $\leq$ is a $\Pi$ respecting monomial order on $K\mon$, then $\leq$ refines the $\Pi$-divisibility quasi-order $|_\Pi$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
 Suppose $a$ and $b$ are monomials with $a |_\Pi b$, so there is some pair $\sigma \in \Pi$, $c \in \mon$ such that $c\sigma a = b$.  From the proof of Proposition \ref{prop:nogroup} we see that $a \leq \sigma a$.  Since $1 \leq c$ and $\leq$ respects multiplication, $\sigma a \leq c\sigma a = b$.
\end{proof}

A implication of this proposition is that if $K\mon$ has a $\Pi$ respecting monomial order then the $\Pi$-divisibility quasi-order must be a partial order, meaning it has the anti-symmetry property: if $a \geq b$ and $a \leq b$ then $a = b$.  If anti-symmetry fails for $|_\Pi$, it will also fail for any refinement.

If $R$ is $\Pi$-Noetherian with a $\Pi$ respecting monomial order, then any $\Pi$-invariant ideal $I \subseteq R$ will have a finite $\Pi$-equivariant Gr\"obner basis.  This follows from the fact that $\LT I$ is $\Pi$-finitely generated.  We recount two previous results that give examples of $\Inc$-Noetherian rings, and will be directly relevant to the results of this paper.

\begin{theorem}[Theorem 1.1 of \cite{hillar2012finite}]\label{thm:HS}
 Let $X = \{x_{ij} \mid i \in [k], j \in \B N\}$, and let $\Sym$ act on $[X]$ by permuting the second index, $\sigma x_{ij} = x_{i\sigma(j)}$ for $\sigma \in \Sym$.  Then $K[X]$ is $\Inc$-Noetherian.
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}[Theorem 1.1 of \cite{draisma2013noetherianity}]\label{thm:DEKL}
 Let $K[Y]$ be a $\Sym$-algebra with $\Sym$ action on variable set $Y$.  Suppose $Y$ has a finite number of $\Sym$-orbits, and $K[Y]$ satisfies the finite width condition.  For $K[X]$ defined as in Theorem \ref{thm:HS}, let $\phi$ be a monomial map
  \[ \phi: K[Y] \to K[X]. \]
 Then
 \begin{itemize}
  \item $\ker \phi$ is $\Inc$-finitely generated,
  \item $\im \phi$ is $\Inc$-Noetherian.
 \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

The conditions on ring $K[Y]$ in Theorem \ref{thm:DEKL} are quite general and Hillar and Sullivant \cite{hillar2012finite} prove that such rings are generally not $\Sym$-Noetherian.  They give the example of $K[Y]$ where $Y = \{y_{ij} \mid i, j \in \B N\}$ with $\sigma y_{ij} = y_{\sigma(i)\sigma(j)}$ for $\sigma \in \Sym$ and prove that Noetherianity fails.

When $R$ is not $\Pi$-Noetherian, we do not know in general if a $\Pi$-finitely generated ideal $I\subseteq R$ has a finite $\Pi$-equivariant Gr\"obner basis, or if so, for which monomial orders.  However we will prove in Section \ref{sec:egbtoric} that the $\Sym$-invariant toric ideal $\ker \phi$ as in Theorem \ref{thm:DEKL} does have finite $\Inc$-equivariant Gr\"obner bases for specifically chosen monomial orders.  This will allow an algorithm to compute such a Gr\"obner basis of $\ker \phi$, given the map $\phi$.

\section{Equivariant Buchberger algorithm}
\subsection{Description of the algorithm}
First proposed in \cite{aschenbrenner2007finite} and formalized in \cite{Brouwer09e}, Buchberger's algorithm can be adapted to the equivariant setting in a straightforward way.

Let $R = K\mon$ with $\Pi$ acting on $\mon$, and let $\leq$ be a $\Pi$ respecting monomial order.  For $f,g \in R$ say that $g$ {\em $\Pi$-reduces} $f$ if $\LT g |_{\Pi} \LT f$ and the reduction is $f - \frac{\LC(f)}{\LC(g)}mg$ where $m \in \mon *\Pi$ such that $\LT f = m\LT g$ (and $\LC(f)$ denotes the lead coefficient of $f$).  For $G \subseteq R$, a {\em $\Pi$-normal form} of $f$ with respect to $G$ denoted $\NF_{\Pi G}(f)$ is the result of repeated $\Pi$-reductions of $f$ by elements of $G$ until no more reductions are possible.  Equivalently $\NF_{\Pi G}(f)$ is a normal form of $f$ with respect to $\Pi G$.

The equivariant Buchberger algorithm is described below, which departs from the conventional Buchberger algorithm only at the step of adding new S-pairs to the list $S$.  This departure is described after, along with a definition of $O_{f,g}$ and the ``finite S-pair condition.''

\begin{algorithm}[Brouwer--Draisma \cite{Brouwer09e}]\label{alg:Buchberger}
$G = \alg{Buchberger}(F)$
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\REQUIRE $F$ is a finite set of elements in $R = K\mon$ with $\Pi$ acting on $\mon$ and satisfying the finite S-pair condition.
\ENSURE $G$ is $\Pi$-equivariant Gr\"obner basis of $\ideal{F}_{\Pi}$.

\STATE $G\gets F$
\STATE $S\gets \bigcup_{f,g\in G} O_{f,g}$
\WHILE{$S\neq\emptyset$}
	\STATE pick $(h_1,h_2) \in S$
	\STATE $S\gets S\setminus\{(h_1,h_2)\}$ 
	\STATE $h \gets \NF_{\Pi G}(h_1 - \frac{\LC(h_1)}{\LC(h_2)}h_2)$
  	\IF{$h \neq 0$}
		\STATE $G\gets G\cup \{h\}$
		\STATE $S\gets S\cup \left(\bigcup_{g\in G}O_{g,h}\right)$
	\ENDIF
\ENDWHILE
\smallskip \hrule \smallskip
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Given $f,g \in R$ define
 \[ \C S_{f,g} := \{(m_1f,m_2g) \mid m_1,m_2 \in \mon * \Pi \text{ such that } \LT m_1f = \LT m_2g\}. \]
This set is closed under the diagonal action of $\mon *\Pi$ making $\C S_{f,g}$ a $\mon *\Pi$-module.  A set $G \subseteq R$ satisfies the {\em equivariant Buchberger criterion} if for all $(h_1,h_2) \in \bigcup_{f,g\in G} \C S_{f,g}$,
 \[ \NF_{\Pi G}(h_1 - \tfrac{\LC(h_1)}{\LC(h_2)}h_2) = 0. \]
The set $G$ is a $\Pi$-equivariant Gr\"obner basis of $\ideal{G}_{\Pi}$ if and only if it satisfies the equivariant Buchberger criterion.  The proof of this fact follows by applying the usual Buchberger criterion to the set $\Pi G$ (see Theorem 2.5 of \cite{Brouwer09e}).

For each pair $f,g \in G$, we need not check the criterion on every pair in $\C S_{f,g}$ which is an infinite set.  It is instead sufficient to check on a $\mon * \Pi$ generating set of $\C S_{f,g}$, which we denote $O_{f,g}$.  Still in general it may be that no finite generating set of $\C S_{f,g}$ exists, in which case we cannot apply the algorithm in finite time.

\begin{definition}
 A $\Pi$-algebra $R = K\mon$ has the {\em finite S-pair condition} if for any $f,g \in R$, the set $\C S_{f,g}$ is finitely generated as a $\mon * \Pi$-module.  In \cite{Brouwer09e} this condition is referred to as ``EGB4.''
\end{definition}

When $\Pi$ is trivial and $R$ is a polynomial ring (the setting of the conventional Buchberger algorithm), $\C S_{f,g}$ is generated by a single pair $(m_1 f,\; m_2 g)$ where $m_1 = \lcm(\LT f, \LT g)/\LT(f)$ and $m_2 = \lcm(\LT f, \LT g)/\LT(g)$.  This generator is typically referred to as the ``S-pair'' of $f,g$.  Therefore $R$ in this case satisfies the finite S-pair condition, and the equivariant Buchberger algorithm specializes to the conventional Buchberger algorithm.

\begin{proposition}
 If $R$ is a polynomial ring $R = K[Y]$ with $\Inc$-action on $[Y]$ satisfying the finite width condition, then $R$ has the finite S-pair condition.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
 Fix $f,g \in R$.
 Since $R$ is a polynomial ring, for fixed $\sigma_1,\sigma_2 \in \Inc$, all elements of $\C S_{f,g}$ of the form $(m_1\sigma_1 f, m_2\sigma_2 g)$ with $m_1,m_2 \in \mon$ are monomial multiplies of the usual S-pair of $\sigma_1 f, \sigma_2 g$,
  \[ \left(\frac{m}{\LT \sigma_1 f} \sigma_1 f,\; \frac{m}{\LT \sigma_2 g} \sigma_2 g\right) \]
 where $m = \lcm(\LT \sigma_1 f,\LT \sigma_2 g)$.

 Any $f,g \in R$ have finite width so $\sigma_1 f$ depends only on $\sigma_1|_{[w(f)]}$, and similarly for $\sigma_2 g$.  In fact we can always factor the pair as
  \[ (\sigma_1 f, \sigma_2 g) = \tau(\rho_1 f, \rho_2 g) \]
 for some $\tau \in \Inc$, while $\rho_1:[w(f)] \to [w(f) + w(g)]$ and $\rho_2:[w(g)] \to [w(f) + w(g)]$ are strictly increasing functions.  Here $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ are chosen to ``interlace'' the variables of $f$ and $g$ in the same way as $\sigma_1,\sigma_2$.  (To consider $\rho_1,\rho_2$ as elements of $\Inc$, take any choice of extensions to maps on $\B N$.)
 
 Then $\C S_{f,g}$ is generated by the finite set of pairs of the form
  \[ \left(\frac{m}{\LT \rho_1 f} \rho_1 f,\; \frac{m}{\LT \rho_2 g} \rho_2 g\right) \]
 with $\rho_1:[w(f)] \to [w(f) + w(g)]$ and $\rho_2:[w(g)] \to [w(f) + w(g)]$ where $m = \lcm(\LT \rho_1 f,\LT \rho_2 g)$.
\end{proof}

We note that Algorithm \ref{alg:Buchberger} is guaranteed to terminate when $R$ is $\Pi$-Noetherian.  Let $G_0,G_1,\ldots$ be the value of $G$ at each step.  The initial ideals of these sets form a strictly increasing chain of $\Pi$-invariant monomial ideals
 \[ \ideal{\LT G_0}_\Pi \subsetneq \ideal{\LT G_1}_\Pi \subsetneq \cdots \]
which must terminate.  However, without Noetherianity, we offer no termination guarantee of the algorithm as stated above, even when a finite equivariant Gr\"obner basis for the ideal exists.  In the next section we give a modification of the algorithm which repairs this when $\Pi = \Inc$ and certain conditions on $R$ are met.

\subsection{Termination of $\Inc$-equivariant Buchberger}
Let $R = K\mon$ with $\Inc$ action on $\mon$, with $R$ satisfying the finite width and finite S-pair conditions, and with each truncation $R_n$ a Noetherian ring.  (These conditions are satisfied for example when $R = K[Y]$ where $Y$ consists of a finite number of orbits of variables, as in Theorem \ref{thm:DEKL}.)   Let $I \subseteq R$ be a $\Inc$-invariant ideal which is $\Inc$-generated by finite set $F$, and moreover has finite $\Inc$-equivariant Gr\"obner basis $G$.  Define the {\em generator truncation} of $I$ to be $\tilde{I}_{F,n} := \ideal{\Inc F \cap R_n} \cap R_n$.  Note that $\tilde{I}_{F,n} \subseteq I_n$ but in general equality does not hold.  For $f \in I$ define $w_F(f)$ to be the minimum value of $n$ for which $f \in \tilde{I}_{F,n}$.

The truncated EGB algorithm again takes finite generating set $F$ as its input.  For each successive $n \geq w(F)$, compute a set $G_n$ such that $\Inc G_n \cap R_n$ is a Gr\"obner basis for $\tilde{I}_{F,n}$.  Then check if $G_n$ is a $\Inc$-equivariant Gr\"obner basis of $I$ using the equivariant Buchberger criterion, and if so return $G_n$.

\begin{algorithm}\label{alg:truncBuch}

\begin{proof}[proof of termination]
For each $n$, let $G_n$ denote the value of $G$ after that step.  Computing $G_n$ is a finite process since it takes place in $R_n$ which is Noetherian.  $G_n$ is a finite set and so it has a finite number of S-pairs to be checked.  Therefore testing whether $G_n$ is a $\Inc$-equivariant Gr\"obner basis is finite.

It remains to be proved that $G_n$ is a $\Inc$-equivariant Gr\"obner basis for some value of $n$.  If $H$ is a $\Inc$-equivariant Gr\"obner basis of $I$, for any $h \in H$ we have $h \in \tilde{I}_{F,n}$ for all $n \geq w_F(h)$, so $\LT(h) \in \LT(\tilde{I}_{F,n})$.  Therefore there is some element $g \in G_n$ with $\LT(g)|_{\Inc} \LT(h)$.  For $n = \max_{h\in H} w_F(h)$, the initial ideal $\ideal{\LT(G_n)}_{\Inc}$ contains $\ideal{\LT(H)}_{\Inc}$ and so $G_n$ is a $\Inc$-equivariant Gr\"obner basis of $I$.
\end{proof}

In practice, $G_n$ can be computed either using a traditional Gr\"obner basis algorithm on input $\Inc F \cap R_n$, or using an equivariant Buchberger algorithm on input $F$ with the following two caveats:
\begin{itemize}
 \item consider only S-pairs $(m_1f, m_2g)$ with $m_1f$ and $m_2g$ both having width $\leq n$,
 \item perform only reductions such that the outcome has width $\leq n$.
\end{itemize}
Moreover we do not need to restart the algorithm from scratch for each $n$.  Instead $G_{n-1} \cup F$ can be used as the input for the $n$th step instead of $F$.

Suppose $R$ has the form $K[Y]$ and each $R_n = K[Y_n]$ for some $Y_n \subseteq Y$.  If $\leq$ is a width order (a monomial order such that $w(a) < w(b)$ implies $a < b$), the second condition is satisfied automatically since reductions cannot increase the width.  Therefore the normal form of a given S-pair does not depend on $n$ and only needs to be computed once.  As a result we can use Algorithm \ref{alg:Buchberger}, queuing S-pairs by width so that the smallest width S-pairs are considered first.  The algorithm terminates once the queue is empty.  A separate check for whether $G_n$ is a $\Inc$-equivariant Gr\"obner basis for $I$ is not needed since this is equivalent to reducing all S-pairs in the queue.

\section{A signature-based approach}

Here we decribe our new approach to computing equiavriant \GBs\ utilizing the information stored in {\em signatures}. 

Signature-based algorithms for computing \GBs\ in the most common (finite-dimensional commutative) setting acquired popularity due to Faugere's F5 (see a short description in \S 4 of Chapter 10 of the new edition of Cox, Little, and O'Shea~\cite{Cox-Little-OShea:I-V-A}) and several other recent works (refs?).      
One of the most concise theoretical setups of a signature-based algorithm is given by Gao {\em et al.} in \cite{Gao-Volny-Wang:signature-GBs}.
