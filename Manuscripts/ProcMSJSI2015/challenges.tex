In this final section, we raise several computational challenges and theoretical problems arising from equivariant Gr\"obner bases (EGB) and asymptotic symbolic algebra.  Often these challenge problems can serve as benchmark tests for sharpening the methods of practitioners who are improving and implementing these new classes of algorithms.

\begin{problem}
Compute symbolically (EGB) generators for the chain of toric ideals $I_n = \ker(y_{ij} \mapsto x_i^3 x_j)$, $1 \leq i \neq j \leq n$.  Compare with \cite{Hillar13, hillar2016corrigendum, KKL:equivariant-markov, draisma2013noetherianity}.  What about with the smaller number of indeterminates $1 \leq j < i \leq n$?  (see \cite[Remark 6.3]{draisma2013noetherianity}).
\end{problem}

The following would advance the basic understanding of the structure of these special class of ideals.

\begin{problem}
Develop the combinatorics to understand the case of kernels with more than two indices such as $\ker(y_{ijk} \mapsto x_i^3 x_j^2 x_k)$?  
%(See \cite{KKL:equivariant-markov}).
\end{problem}

It is likely that an approach that uses the representation theory of the symmetric group will be productive.  For instance, one could develop further the application of ideas from \cite{camina1991some} to Lattice ideals.

\begin{problem}
Develop tools from representation theory to understand the structure of equivariant ideals.
\end{problem}

There are also some basic questions in the theory of equivariant Gr\"obner bases that remain open.  For instance, it is not so well-understood exactly which classes of ideals have finite generation, much less an equivariant Gr\"obner basis.  Even when finite generation is known, basic questions still remain.  For instance, while it is now known that chains of kernels induced by monomials stabilize \cite{aschenbrenner2007finite, KKL:equivariant-markov, draisma2013noetherianity}, it is still not known whether there is a nice algorithmic generating set.

\begin{question}
Is there an equivariant Gr\"obner basis for chains of toric ideals induced by a monomial?
\end{question}

One largely unexplored aspect of research efforts to date is the structure of term orders for equivariant Gr\"obner bases.  In the classical application of Gr\"obner bases, term orders can play a significant role.  As a first challenge, we ask the following naive question.

\begin{question}
Is there an equivariant Gr\"obner fan?  (See \cite{sturmfels1996grobner}).
\end{question}

There are of course theoretical questions involving the structure of these generating sets.  For instance, here is a basic problem.  Fix an infinite graph $G = (V,E)$ on vertices $V = \{1,2,\ldots\}$, and consider ideals generated by $\{x_i^3-1: i \in V\}$ and $\{x_i^2 + x_i x_j +x_j^2: \{i,j\} \in E\}$.  The equations cut out the possible vertex $3$-colorings of $G$ (colors are cube roots of unity) and the proper $3$-colorings (adjacent vertices have different colors), respectively.  Supposing that the set of edges have a large set of symmetries, finite computations involving these algebraic objects can lead to new theory and improvements to existing algorithms.  Moreover, there is likely a rich structure theory underlying these basic combinatorial ideals.

\begin{problem}\label{graphprob}
Develop theoretical and computational applications of equivariant Gr\"obner bases to infinite graph theory.
\end{problem}

More questions about toric ideals can also be asked.  For instance, as far as we know, it is still an open question whether every toric chain of ideals stabilizes (see \cite{Hillar13} for evidence in the Laurent case).  This guiding question in asymptotic polynomial algebra has led to much progress in the field.

\begin{question}
Does every toric chain of ideals stabilize?
\end{question}

In classical computational algebra, Gr\"obner bases do more than simply answer ideal membership questions.  They also answer basic questions about the underlying geometry and algebra such as dimension, degree, Hilbert series, etc.  

\begin{problem}
Develop a mapping from EGBs to geometric properties of infinite varieties.  (See e.g. \cite{Nagel, krone2016hilbert} for Hilbert series).
\end{problem}

Another exciting area of combinatorial asymptotic algebra research is the computation of degree bounds for various symmetric ideals. 
For instance, in \cite{draisma2014bounded, Draisma12f} a universal degree bound for generators (up to symmetry) cutting out tensors of a given border rank was shown to exist.  However, explicit bounds for this degree are typically only known in special cases.  Other questions arise from the study of special cases of toric chains.  For instance, prove what are the numbers in the tables in \cite{KKL:equivariant-markov, Hillar13, hillar2016corrigendum}, which enumerate minimal degrees for generators of the infinite chain.

\begin{problem}
Prove bounds for structure constants of chains of ideals..
\end{problem}

Given the powerful applications of Gr\"obner bases methods to understanding systems of polynomial equations, it is natural to ask how much of this machinery transfers over to the equivariant case.

\begin{problem}
Develop an effective elimination theory for asymptotic polynomial algebra.
\end{problem}

In tandem with the previous problem, efforts to understand the cost of running these algorithms should be undertaken.

\begin{problem}
Determine computational complexity bounds for these algorithmic problems.  (See e.g. \cite{yap2000fundamental}).
\end{problem}

Most of the considerations here have involved specific monoids, such as the monoid of increasing functions or the symmetric group.  It is natural to study other actions on ideals.

\begin{problem}
Study equivariant Gr\"obner bases for other monoids.
\end{problem}

Question of finiteness in non-commutative settings have inspired workers in Gr\"obner bases from early days \cite{shirshov1962some, bokut1976embeddings, bergman1978diamond} to recent times \cite{drensky2006grobner, la2009letterplace}.

\begin{problem}
Develop practical non-commutative extensions to equivariant Gr\"obner bases.
\end{problem}

With these and other fundamental problems still unresolved, the field of asymptotic algebra has many productive years ahead of itself.
