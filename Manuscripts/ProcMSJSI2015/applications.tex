Groebner bases:

Drensky ``Grobner bases of ideals invariant under endomorphism".




Here we list the various applications of computation in rings with infinite numbers of indeterminates.  

\subsubsection{Group theory}

First studied in the context of group theory by Cohen in \cite{cohen1967laws}.

\subsubsection{Chemistry}

First appeared in algebraic chemistry \cite{} Ruch reference, and then attacked here \cite{aschenbrenner2007finite} and here Draisma \cite{Draisma08b}.

\subsubsection{Algebraic Statistics}

Diaconis Sturmfels \cite{diaconis1998algebraic}.

Independent set conjecture proved here \cite{hillar2012finite}, but early Japanese references \cite{}.

abelian tree models \cite{draisma2015finiteness}.

finiteness $k$-factor model chirality varieties \cite{Draisma08b}.

ideals of equivariant tree models \cite{draisma2009ideals}.

\subsubsection{Algebraic Geometry}

moduli space $n$ points in a line \cite{howard2009equations}.

length of Betti table goes to infinity: \cite{ein2015asymptotics}

and positivity of the the embedding line bundle grows: \cite{ein2012asymptotic}

also, more Draisma \cite{draisma2015plucker}.

\subsubsection{Topology}

Homological stability \cite{randal2013homological} and \cite{church2012homological}.


\subsubsection{Toric Algebra}



See \cite{Hillar13, hillar2016corrigendum} and \cite{draisma2013noetherianity}.  And recently \cite{KKL:equivariant-markov}.

\subsubsection{Tensor Geometry}

Here is a link to Draisma's work on this:  \cite{draisma2014bounded}.

\subsubsection{Category Theory and Asymptotic Algebra}

FI-algebras \cite{church2014fi, church2015fi}.  Asymptotic Hilbert series \cite{Nagel}, \cite{krone2016hilbert} and commutative algebra. 

General linear group replacing symmetric group \cite{}.

\subsubsection{Representation and category theory}

Noetherian property of infinite EI categorie \cite{gan2015noetherian}

\cite{putman2014representation}

grobner methods for representations of combinatorial categories: \cite{sam2016grobner}

GL-equivariant \cite{sam2016gl}
