Here we list the various applications of computation in rings with infinite numbers of indeterminates.  

\subsubsection{Group theory}

First studied in the context of group theory by Cohen in \cite{cohen1967laws}.

\subsubsection{Chemistry}

First appeared in algebraic chemistry \cite{} Ruch reference, and then attacked here \cite{aschenbrenner2007finite} and here Draisma \cite{Draisma08b}.

\subsubsection{Algebraic Statistics}

Independent set conjecture proved here \cite{hillar2012finite}, but early Japanese references \cite{}.

\subsubsection{Toric Algebra}

See \cite{Hillar13, hillar2016corrigendum} and \cite{draisma2013noetherianity}.  And recently \cite{KKL:equivariant-markov}.

\subsubsection{Tensor Geometry}

Here is a link to Draisma's work on this:  \cite{draisma2014bounded}.

\subsubsection{Category Theory and Asymptotic Algebra}

FI-algebras \cite{church2014fi, church2015fi}.  Asymptotic Hilbert series \cite{Nagel}, \cite{krone2016hilbert} and commutative algebra. 

\subsubsection{Representation and category theory}

Noetherian property of infinite EI categorie \cite{gan2015noetherian}

\cite{putman2014representation}
